          <h1>Perfect Crispy French fries</h1>
          <p>
            Finally, here it is – The perfect french fries recipe! Based on a
            ground-breaking method from the legendary Kenji López-Alt’s The Food
            Lab, these hot chips are so crispy they stay that way even after
            they’ve gone cold. It’s rare to find fries this good even at
            up-market bistros!

            <li><h2>Potato</h2></li>
            <p>
              The type is important. Starchy, floury potatoes are the potatoes
              you need for crispy fries.

            <li><h2>Vinegar</h2></li>
            <p>
              For simmering the potatoes, it is one secret weapon for perfect
              fries. There is no trace of vinegar flavour once cooked. See Step
              4 below for the why.
            </p>
            <li><h2>Salt</h2></li>
            <p>
              For seasoning the water so the potatoes are seasoned all the way
              through.
            </p>
            <li><h2>Oil</h2></li>
            <p>
              For frying. I use vegetable or canola oil which are
              neutrally-flavoured oils. Re-using the oil: The oil can be re-used
              3 to 4 times, or more. It won’t even need to be strained. Just
              cool, pour into jars and keep in the pantry, and have a browse in
              this recipe collection to decide what to make next!

          <h2 style="font-weight: 700">How to make stay-crispy French fries</h2>
          <p>
            To get ahead or cook big batches, make the fries up to the end of
            Fry #1, cool then freeze until you’re ready to cook. Then do Fry #2
            from frozen. Handy!

                Cut fries – First, we have to cut our fries. A neat little
                crispy fries trick you may not have seen before: use a serrated
                knife to cut<br />
                the potatoes. Though not visible to the eye, it makes the
                surface rougher therefore creating more surface area to crisp up
                =<br />
                crispier fries! What size to cut the fries: 6 mm / 1/4″ batons
                is the ideal size for optimum crispiness and fluffy insides.
                Thicker =<br />
                less crispy. Thinner = not enough fluffiness inside. How to
                slice: Cut a whole potato into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick slices. Stack 2
                or 3<br />
                slices then cut into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick batons.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Keep in water to prevent browning – Keep cut fries in water to
                prevent them from browning as you continue cutting. No soaking
                time is actually required. A simple rinse followed by simmering
                the potatoes in vinegar water takes care of this for us.

            <li>
              <p>
                Rinse – Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then
                rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds. This is the first
                step to remove excess sugars from the surface of the potatoes
                (more on the “why” of this below, but in short it’s to aid
                crispiness – of course!). Meanwhile, the insides remain
                untouched by water so they’ll cook up nice and fluffy.

            <li>
              <p>
                Cook in vinegar water = superior crispiness – Once the potatoes
                are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water, vinegar and
                salt. Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately turn down to
                low so the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes. See
                below for the “why” for this step!

                Drain and dry – Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove
                the potatoes from the water into a colander. Then carefully
                spread the potatoes out on two tea towel-lined trays to steam
                dry for 5 minutes. No need to pat them dry, the residual heat
                will do the job for us.

                    Oil temperature – Preheat the oil to 205°C/400°F. Use a
                    thermometer to monitor the temperature. I use a Thermapen,
                    see my Essential Kitchenwares post for more details.

              <p>
                ⚠️ IMPORTANT: For safety reasons, please follow the directions
                to pause 10 seconds between adding batches of more potato into
                the oil! As you can see in the photos below, the oil bubbles up
                quite high and vigorously as soon as you add some potato. If you
                add all the potato in one go, the oil will bubble up even higher
                and faster, which is risky. I’m speaking from first hand
                experience here!
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Cook the fries in 3 batches – Separate the cooked potatoes
                    into 3 even piles (batches). We will be doing Fry #1 in
                    three batches in a 24 cm / 10″ pot. If your pot is larger or
                    smaller, adjust the number of batches accordingly so all the
                    fries in one batch can float in a single layer in the oil.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Add 1/3 of Batch #1 – Using a spider or slotted spoon,
                    carefully add 1/3 of the first batch into the oil.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    ⚠️ WAIT 10 seconds then add another 1/3 of batch #1. Pausing
                    before adding more fries is important to ensure the oil
                    doesn’t bubble up too high. Use this time to load up, ready
                    to add more fries.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Repeat – Wait 10 seconds, then add the final 1/3 of Batch
                    #1.

                    twice.

                spoon and spread onto a paper towel-lined tray in a single
                layer. They will be pale and not yet crispy. Carry out Fry #1
                for the remaining two batches using the same staggered approach
                (ie. 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3) within each batch. Ensure the oil is back
                at 205°C/400°F before starting each batch. Then cool all the
                fries for 30 minutes on some paper towel-lined trays.

                minutes until they are a gorgeous golden colour and wonderfully
                crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon into a large paper

                Seasoning! – Now that your fries are done, sprinkle with salt or
                your favourite fries seasoning while hot so the salt sticks.
                Toss, then serve! Remember, these fries will stay crispy for
                more than 15 minutes, though of course they are best consumed
                piping hot! Tip: Remember these French fries are also pre-salted
                inside because we blanched them in salted water. So don’t go too
                crazy with the seasoning salt. Sprinkle judiciously, taste (I
                know, I hate to ask that of you), and then sprinkle more if you
                think it needs it.
