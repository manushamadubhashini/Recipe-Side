      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Alyssa Rivers, also known as “The Recipe Critic.” She’s all about
        creating delicious meals for families, loved by both adults and kids. As
        a mom of four, Alyssa understands the struggle of juggling everything in
        life. But here’s the twist – she believes you shouldn’t have to choose
        between a tasty meal and one that’s quick and easy. According to Alyssa,
        you can have both!
      </p>
      <p>
        And that’s where The Tried and True Cookbook comes in. It’s packed with
        family recipes, favorites from readers, and some brand-new exclusive
        content. The goal? To bring you recipes that are not just easy to make
