          <h1 style>Supreme Soy Noodles</h1>
          <p>
            These tasty noodles might be simple but I make them a LOT! Perfect
            for all those times you’re scrambling for a quick side dish for
            Asian foods and want something more interesting than plain rice.
            Flavoured enough to devour as-is, neutral enough to serve alongside
            main dishes. Supremely easy, supremely tasty – Supreme Soy Noodles!

            What you need to make these soy noodles
          </h2>
          <p>
            The sauce for these noodles is based around soy sauce. But here’s
            the thing – you can’t use only soy for a good noodle sauce! Soy-only
            sauces are one-dimensional and bland. Instead we’re also using a
            handful of staple Asian sauces here to add depth and character.
            Ready-to-use sauces like these also minimises the list of
            ingredients while still delivering big on flavour!

            <p>
              The dominant flavour in this sauce, I’m using a combination of
              dark and light soy sauce here. Together they deliver the flavour
              and colour I am aiming for. Dark soy sauce has a more intense
              flavour and stains the noodles a beautiful mahogany colour you can
              see in the photo below. The light soy sauce adds extra salt
              without too much colour so the sauce doesn’t get too dark. See
              recipe notes for how to switch these out, and more on different
              soy sauces here!

            <li><h2>Oyster sauce</h2></li>
            <p>
              Sweet, salty, thick and pungent, oyster sauce is one of the secret
              ingredients in this recipe. Oyster sauce punches high above its
              weight when it comes to adding incomparable complexity, flavour
              and umami all at once to any dish you add a few dashes of the
              stuff to. A staple sauce in Chinese and South-east Asian cooking,
              it’s made from oyster extract which gives it that intensely
              savoury flavour. However it doesn’t tasty oyster-y (is that a
              word??) or fishy at all. See recipe notes for substitutes.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><h2>Mirin</h2></li>
            <p>
              This is a sweet Japanese cooking wine that is the other secret
              ingredient that brings flavour and nuance to this dish. Typically
              in Chinese recipes you’d see Chinese cooking wine used with a
              touch of sugar added when needed. But today, I’m taking a shortcut
              by using mirin which already has sugar in it. One less ingredient
              needed! Non-alcoholic substitute – Use more oyster sauce.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><h2>Sesame oil</h2></li>
            <p>
              Toasted (ie brown-hued) as opposed to un-toasted (yellow-hued,
              with less sesame flavour). Here in Australia, toasted sesame oil
              is the norm. It’s actually hard to find un-toasted. Note the
              sesame oil is added to the sauce and not used for as frying fat,
              because it loses flavour the longer it’s cooked.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><h2>Green onion</h2></li>
            <p>
              Serving dual functions here. One, as an aromatic flavour base when
              we sauté the white part with the garlic to flavour the oil. Later,
              the green parts are used to add a touch of colour and bite
              throughout the noodles.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><h2>Garlic</h2></li>
            <p style="font-size: 19px">
              You’ll be hard pressed to find a recipe on this website that
              doesn’t include garlic.

            <li><h2>Noodles</h2></li>
            <p>
              Use any noodles you want – white or yellow, thick or thin, dried
              or fresh. I used fresh white noodles (from the fridge section of
              my shop) which I generally prefer over dried noodles. I like the
              texture better, it’s chewier and also has better flavour. Having
              said that, this recipe will work just fine with dried noodles too.
              Or even spaghetti. Yes, there, I said it! It sounds so wrong, but
              dried spaghetti is just flour and water, same as many dried
              noodles. So once it’s tossed with the sauce, you really can’t tell
              the difference!!

                Green onion – Cut up the green onion, separating the darker
                green part from the firmer white and pale green parts. We’re
                going to cook the white part first as they take longer to cook.
                The green part only needs to be tossed in at the very end as it
                wilts in seconds.

                Cook noodles per the packet directions. Some tips: – Cook
                noodles just before you start stir frying. Don’t leave cooked,
                drained noodles lying around before stir frying as it makes them
                more prone to breaking or sticking to each other. – Use plenty
                of boiling water so the noodles cook evenly and loosen. – Rinse
                the noodles briefly after draining so they don’t end up sticking
                together in a gluey block.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Sauté aromatics – Using either a wok or large non-stick pan over
                high heat, heat the oil until very hot. Then we start by cooking
                the white and pale green part of the green onion for around 20
                seconds to give them a head start as well as flavouring the oil.
                Then, toss the garlic in and cook for around 10 seconds just
                until lightly golden. Don’t let the garlic burn – it goes
                bitter!

            <li>
              <p>
                Noodles and sauce – Add the noodles and sauce then toss for
                around 1 1/2 minutes until all the noodles are evenly coated in
                the sauce and you start to see some of the noodles caramelising
                a bit. It might take a bit longer depending on the strength of
                your stove. Don’t skip the caramelisation step! It adds such
                great flavour to the noodles
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Green onion – Lastly, add the green part of the green onions
                then toss for 30 seconds just until wilted. That’s it, you’re
                done! Ready to serve!
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <b>To serve,</b> either transfer all the noodles into a large
            serving dish and let everyone serve themselves, or divide between
            individual serving plates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Garnishes –</b> I don’t use any garnishes here so it can be
            served as a side dish. But if you want to pretty it up, a sprinkle
            of finely sliced green onion or sesame seeds (or both!) wouldn’t go
            astray.
