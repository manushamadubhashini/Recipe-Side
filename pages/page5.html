          <h1>Ratatouille – French Vegetable Stew</h1>
          <p>
            Ratatouille is a French vegetable stew that at first glance seems
            like a simple, humble dish. But made well, it punches well above its
            weight, a summery stunner bursting with Mediterranean flavours! The
            key to a great ratatouille is to sauté each vegetable separately
            before braising together. Healthy, versatile, and not just
            vegetarian but also 100% vegan. Vegans rejoice!

          <p>
            Here’s what I put in my Ratatouille, but don’t feel limited to these
            vegetables! While these are the most traditional Ratatouille
            inclusions, any suitable vegetables that can be sautéed will work a
            treat – think mushrooms, fennel, celery, squash etc. I honestly
            wouldn’t hesitate to throw in a handful of wiltable greens either
            (like kale, spinach etc) if that’s what you have!
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><h3>Olives</h3></li>
            <li><h3>Garlic</h3></li>
            <li><h3>Thyme</h3></li>

            <li><h2>Vegetables</h2></li>
            <p>
              I used an eggplant, 2 capsicums / bell peppers (one red, one
              yellow = colour splash!) and 2 zucchinis (courgettes);
            </p>
            <li><h2>Tomatoes (for the sauce)</h2></li>
            <p>
              Using a fresh tomato to me seems appropriate for a dish like
              Ratatouille where the whole idea is to celebrate fresh produce,
              but feel free to use canned tomato or passata. If you do, use a
              good brand please (I’m partial to Mutti). This is the sauce for
              this dish, so don’t ruin it with cheap, sour, flavourless canned
              tomato!!
            </p>
            <li><h2>Onion and garlic</h2></li>
            <p>
              The flavour base. You’d be hard pressed to find a savoury dish on
              this website that doesn’t start with these two!!
            </p>
            <li><h2>Fresh thyme and basil</h2></li>
            <p>
              Thyme is for the braising, and basil for a fresh finish. Plenty of
              alternatives exist here so don’t fret if you don’t have these two
              exact herbs. A sprinkle of dried oregano instead would be totally
              at home, or even mixed herbs for that matter. To finish, fresh
              parsley would go down a treat;
            </p>
            <li><h2>Olives</h2></li>
            <p>
              For little salty pops littered throughout the stew. Not too many,
              so they don’t dominate. They’re backing vocals here to the lead
              singer veggies!
            </p>

          <h2 style="font-weight: 700">How to make Ratatouille</h2>
          <p>
            As tempting as it is to throw all the vegetables into the pot and
            cook them at the same time, don’t! That’s the path to a big pot of
            flavourless mush. You simply can’t get any colour on them this way
            (they just go watery and stew in their own juices) and because each
            vegetable takes a different length of time to cook, you will
            inevitably overcook some.
          </p>

            alt="THis is a image"
            height="250"
            width="800"
          />
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Tomato puree for sauce – Chop the tomato and blitz using your
                appliance of choice. No need to do this if using canned crushed
                tomato or passata;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Sweat eggplant – Sprinkle the eggplant with salt then set aside
                for 30 minutes to make them sweat. By this, I mean that the salt
                will draw water out of the eggplant and you’ll see little beads
                of moisture on the surface. The salt also tenderises the flesh
                of the eggplant and makes the eggplant absorb less oil when
                cooking. Common wisdom also claims that salt removes the bitter
                taste in eggplants. However the reality is modern eggplants have
                had any bitterness bred out of them so it’s not a necessary step
                today. Unlike when making like eggplant “sheets” for things like
                Moussaka, there’s no need to pat the water off before cooking.
                It will just evaporate when we start sautéing. Also, we want to
                keep the salt for flavour;
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <img
            src="/images/recipe39.jpg"
            alt="THis is a image"
            height="250"
            width="800"
          />
          <ol start="3">
            <li>
              <p>
                Cook eggplant – Sauté the eggplant over high heat in a large
                non-stick skillet for around 4 to 5 minutes until you get some
                nice colour on them, but they are still a touch firm inside and
                holding their form (ie. hasn’t collapsed into mush). No need to
                fully cook; they will finish cooking during the braising step.
                The key part here is getting some golden colour on the eggplant
                – this adds great flavour! Once done, transfer the eggplant to a
                large pot in which all the vegetables will be combined to
                braise. Add each veg to this pot as you sauté them off. See
                below for why we use a separate pot;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Onion and garlic – Next, cook the onion and garlic until the
                onion is soft and sweet, about 3 to 4 minutes. Then transfer to
                the pot;
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          />
          <ol start="5">
            <li>
              <p>
                Capsicum / bell peppers – Cook the capsicum for about 3 minutes
                just to cook the outside, while keeping them sufficiently firm
                on the inside so they don’t turn to mush when braised. You won’t
                get browning on the capsicum during this short cook time but
                that’s fine, this still enhances the flavour;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Sauté zucchini – Repeat for the zucchini, about 3 minutes of
                sautéing. As with the capsicum, you won’t get much colour on
                them in the time it takesto cook the exterior but that’s fine;
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <img
            src="/images/recipe41.jpg"
            alt="THis is a image"
            height="250"
            width="800"
          />
          <ol start="7">
            <li>
              <p>
                Braise everything – With all the vegetables in the pot, add the
                tomato, thyme, salt and pepper. Mix well, and stew on low for 20
                – 25 minutes with the lid off until all the vegetables have
                gotten to know each other and are tender;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Done! The Ratatouille should be thick enough that you can pile
                it up on a plate, but is still moist and juicy. Have a taste and
                add more salt and pepper if desired. You might even want to
                really let your hair down and add a pinch of red pepper flakes
                for a touch of fire! To finish it off, just stir through the
                basil and it’s ready to serve! Either spoon it into a big shared
                dish for people to help themselves, or into individual bowls. I
                also like to add a final drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and
                an extra sprinkling of fresh basil.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>
            Why sauté in a skillet then braise in a different pot? Simply for a
            better result. A skillet is ideal for sautéing here thanks to the
            thick metal (better heat retention and heat transfer) and its
            shallow sides. A taller pot meanwhile is needed later to hold all
            the vegetables to stew together. If you try to sauté in the pot, it
            will take longer and tend to stew in its juices as it cooks due to
            the high sides, discouraging colouration. We want the stewing action
            later, not while sautéing!
