        <p>
          Welcome to my kitchen! I am Alyssa Rivers, published cookbook author
          of ‘The Tried and True Cookbook‘ and I am the foodie behind The Recipe
          Critic. This website launched in 2012 as a place to share my passion
          for cooking. The Recipe Critic is home to thousands of recipes that
          have been tried, tested, and approved by the world’s most honest
          critics… Kids and families from all over the world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My goal is to provide families with quick and easy meals that don’t
          sacrifice taste. From slow cooker meals to one-pot meals, air fryer
          recipes, baked casseroles, grilled delights, and desserts galore, my
          recipes are everything that you need! Your family and guests will keep
          coming back for more!

          As a kid, my grandma taught me the art of baking from scratch –
          pancakes, bread, and cookies were her specialties. Those early kitchen
          adventures sparked a lifelong passion for creating delicious meals.
          Fast forward to adulthood, with four kids of my own, I realized I
          wanted to share that same joy of cooking with others. And so, The
          Recipe Critic was born.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At The Recipe Critic, my goal is simple: to make cooking accessible
          and enjoyable for everyone. I specialize in crafting recipes that are
          not only easy and budget-friendly but also bursting with flavor.
          Whether it’s whipping up a family-favorite like Baked Sweet and Sour
          Chicken or indulging in this refreshing a No-Bake Key Lime Pie,
          there’s something here for every palate.
